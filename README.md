# Simatrix
A grid-based simulation engine for AI agents in C++.

The goal is to start from a core world design consisting of grids with cells of different types, then expand into agent behaviour, rule-based AI, and finally simulation mechanics. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Day 1:
- 2D world representation (grid based)
- World display using ASCII characters
- CellType using enum: empty, wall and agent types.
- Cell modification using setCellType()

## Compile:
g++ main.cpp -o game
./game 

# Built With
- C++ 17
- STL
- Pure logic and terminal based UI
